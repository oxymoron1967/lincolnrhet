            <p>Of all the presidents, Abraham Lincoln was probably the greatest speechwriter. Many of his phrases are widely quoted, including “With malice toward none” and “a house divided against itself cannot stand”, and the Gettysburg Address is possibly the greatest American political speeches. His speeches are worth a closer look. There are websites that discuss Lincoln and his rhetoric, such as Abraham Lincoln Online, but I didn’t see anything that does what I’m trying to do. </p>

            <h2><p id="context"></p>Historical Context</h2>

            <br><br>

            <h3>

           <p>Abraham Lincoln’s political career lasted from the 1830s, when he got involved in Illinois state politics, until his assassination in 1865. Because his political career lasted for so long, I felt I had to divide his speeches into mostly chronology based categories:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Pre-presidential speeches: these are speeches Lincoln made from the 1830s to 1860, when Lincoln was elected President.</li>

                <li>The Lincoln-Douglas debates, which took place in 1858, during the campaign for senate. These seven debates were held across the state – Illinois had nine Congressional districts at the time, and each debate was held in a different district. </li>

                <li>The Inaugural Train Trip speechesm. These are usually brief speeches Lincoln made during his train trip from Springfield, Illinois to Washington, D.C in February 1861. </li>

                <li>Presidential speeches are the last set of speeches. I included the Emancipation Proclamation here, even though it’s not technically a speech. I just think it’s an important document to include when discussing Lincoln </li>

            </ol>

            <p>I had to change the format on the map, and the legend was somehow erased. So I've put it here:</p>

           
            <ol>

            <li>Blue dots are speeches Lincoln gave before he was elected president.</li>

            <li>Purple dots are the locations of the Lincoln-Douglas debates</li>

            <li>Green dots are stops on the Inaugural Train Trip</li>

            <li>Orange dots are speeches Lincoln made while he was president.</li>

            <li>Black dots are colleges which gave Lincoln honorary PhDs. 

                <p>I included this because a college gave Lincoln an honorary degree in 2009, which amused me.</p>
            </li>

           

           </ol>
           
           <br><br>

           <p>A few notes on the map</p>

           <br><br>

           <ol>

            <li>I could not map all the speeches, and, honestly, Illinois would be covered in dots. So I selected certain speeches. My favorite is the Lost Speech in Bloomington. We know he gave a speech there, but we don’t know much about it. </li>

            <li>Lincoln did visit New England, but I didn’t include the speeches he made there. If I revisit this, I may include these.</li>

            <li>As with the pre-presidential speeches, if I included more of Lincoln's presidential speeches, there would be a large cluster of dots on Washington, DC.</li>


           </ol>

            <a href="https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/projects/lincoln-speeches">The Speeches on Manifold</a>

            <br><br>

            <p>For an explanation of Manifold, here is a blurb from their website:

                <br><br>

                <blockquote>Manifold instance serves as a free digital publishing platform for the entire CUNY community, where you can create and share your own scholarship, custom classroom versions of texts and textbooks that are openly licensed or in the public domain.</blockquote>
            </p>


            <br><br>

            <p>Since Manifold allows annotation of texts and the addition of multimedia elements, I thought it would be a good platform for this project. Perhaps the biggest issue was including pronunciation guides. I used the International Phonetic Alphabet for this, however, I couldn't do this directly in the annotations. I had to open Google docs, do the transcription there, then, cut and paste the transcription onto Manifold.</p>

            <br><br>

            <p>Also, I had used Manifold to build a <a href="https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/projects/poetry-speech-database">speech and poetry database</a>, so I was already familiar with it.</p>

            <h2><p id="voyant"></p>Text Analysis with Voyant</h2>

            <br><br>

            <h3>

            <p>For an explanation of Voyant-tools, here is a blurb from their website:

                <br><br>

                <blockquote>Voyant Tools is a web-based text reading and analysis environment. It is a scholarly project that is designed to facilitate reading and interpretive practices for digital humanities students and scholars as well as for the general public.</blockquote>
            </p>

                <br><br>


            <p>As I stated above in the map section, I broke the speeches down into four categories: Pre-presidential Speeches, the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, Inaugural Train Trip Speeches, and, finally, Presidential speeches. </p>

            <ol>
                
                <li><a href="https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=c9506f0b8aee4278e6fcec70a09d7a23">Pre=Presidential Speeches</a>

                <br><br>

                <p>These speeches date from the 1830’s until 1860. You’ll notice the word cloud separates related words, such as “slave”, “slaves”, and “slavery”. Most of the speeches dealt with slavery, which is born out in the word cloud. If you explore the page, you will see the context for various words within the texts. </p>

                <br><br>

                <p>The 1854 speech against the Kansas-Nebraska Act is easily the longest speech here, more than twice the length of the next longest speech, the Cooper Union speech. As a result, the results here are heavily influenced by the 1854 speech, but the themes present there are found in most of the other speeches. For instance,  Missouri, Kansas, and Nebraska all appear in the speech against the Kansas-Nebraska Act, but they are still all mentioned in other speeches as well.

                <li><a href="https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=08b7f828f6f7ce18dc2779165337cf1a">Lincoln's Responses in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates</a>
                
                <br><br>

                <p>This section is Lincoln’s parts of the Lincoln-Douglas Debates of 1858. I only included Lincoln’s parts here because this is about Lincoln’s rhetoric, and not Stephen A. Douglas’s rhetoric. </p>

                <br><br>

                <p>“Judge” and “Douglas” are the two most common words in this corpus because Stephen A. Douglas was a judge, so that’s what Lincoln called him. By the time of these debates, the summer of 1858, slavery was the most important and divisive issue in the country, so the prominence of the words “slavery” and “constitution” makes sense.</p>

                <br><br>

                <p>In terms of size, this is the largest corpus, and the difference in size of the individual documents isn’t as extreme as they are in the other sections.</p>

                <br><br>
                
                <li><a href="https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=844fbcd0b02eebc743ad14cf955b3f1b&panels=cirrus,reader,trends,summary,contexts">Inauguration Train Trip Speeches</a></li>

                <br><br>

                <p>These speeches were all made in February of 1861, when Lincoln traveled to Washington, DC for his inauguration, which, at that point, was held in early March. Several of the Confederate states had already seceded, but the Civil War hadn’t started yet. You can see that reflected in the word cloud, with words like “people”, “country”, “state”, and “principle”.</p>

                <br><br>

                <p>The most prominent outlier here in terms of subject matter is also the shortest speech. Lincoln’s farewell to Springfield doesn’t mention policy at all. Here, he is saying goodbye to his friends and neighbors.  </p></li>

                <br><br>

                
                <li><a href="https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=e322581000c53fd613d7e991de80da9b&panels=cirrus,reader,trends,summary,contexts">Presidential Speeches</a>

                <br><br>

                <p>This section is a selection of presidential speeches and the Emancipation Proclamation. All but the First Inaugural Address were made after the Civil War started. You can see this in the word cloud, with words like “government”, “union”, “people”, and “constitution”. </p>

                <br><br>

                <p>The First Inaugural Address is easily the longest speech here. It’s longer than all the other speeches in this section combined, so it skews the data presented. </p></li>
